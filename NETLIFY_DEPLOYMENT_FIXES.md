# Netlify Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Missing Dependencies in Netlify Functions**
   - Added `express-validator`, `express-rate-limit`, `googleapis`, and `axios` to external_node_modules in netlify.toml
   - Added these dependencies to the functions/package.json

2. **Google Calendar and Microsoft Calendar API Removal**
   - Replaced calendar.js route with a simplified placeholder version
   - Removed googleapis dependency from package.json
   - Updated environment variables to remove unnecessary Google/Microsoft API keys

3. **Build Process Improvements**
   - Added Netlify plugin for function dependency installation
   - Modified package.json to explicitly install function dependencies

## Key Files Changed

1. **netlify.toml**
   - Added missing external dependencies
   - Added Netlify plugin for functions installation

2. **package.json (root)**
   - Added install:functions script
   - Updated build process

3. **routes/calendar.js**
   - Replaced with simplified version that doesn't use Google/Microsoft APIs

4. **setup-netlify-functions.js**
   - Updated to include all necessary dependencies in function package.json

## Testing

The build should now successfully complete with:
- Frontend built properly
- Function dependencies properly installed and bundled
- No errors about missing dependencies

## Next Steps

After deploying to Netlify:
1. Check that the frontend loads properly
2. Verify that API endpoints work correctly
3. Test that any routes previously using Google/Microsoft Calendar APIs gracefully degrade

## Environment Variables Still Required
